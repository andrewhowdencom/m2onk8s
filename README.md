Description should probably go here. But I'm lazy, so not right now.

## Versioning Strategy

The repository follows the follow versioning strategy:

```
${APP_VERSION}-${BUILD_NUMBER}
```

The app version follows the upstream Magnento build version, with all other deployable changes being a simple numeric increment.
For example,

```
2.1.7-1
```

This is inspired by the Debian versioning strategy.
