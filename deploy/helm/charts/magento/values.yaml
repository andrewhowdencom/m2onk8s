## Change the name of the resource
## Default: use the chart name
# nameOverride:

magento:
  ## The URL at which the store will be accessed
  # baseUrl:
  admin:
    ## The "root" account for the store admin
    user: "admin"
    ## The password for the above "root" account
    ## Default: 32 character random string
    # password:

mysql:
  ## The user that will access the MySQL database
  mysqlUser: "magento"

    ## The image to use with the resource
    ## Ref: https://quay.io/littlemanco/magento:latest
    image: quay.io/littlemanco/magento:latest
    ## Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host’s network namespace. If this option is set, the ports that
    ## will be used must be specified.
    ## Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1/definitions/#_v1_podspec
    hostNetwork: false
    ## Use the host’s pid namespace
    ## Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/api-reference/v1/definitions/#_v1_podspec

    securityContext:
      ## Whether the container should be run in "privileged" mode (essentially, root on the host)

service:
  ## What scope the service should be exposed in. One of:
  ## - LoadBalancer (to the world)
  ## - ClusterIP (to the cluster)
  ## - NodePort (to the world, in a custom way)
  type: "LoadBalancer"
  ## If there is a port associated with a given service, expose it here.
  # port:
  ## If there is a particular IP that should be used for the service, specify it here.
  ## Note: It's quite unlikely that an IP should be specific. Normally, the best thing to do is leave it to Kubernetes
  ##       to allocate a free IP from the pool.
  ## Default: Automatically assign a random IP
  # privateIp:
  ## Only relevant if the `type` above is "LoadBalancer"
  loadBalancer:
    ## If there is already a reserved public IP that this load balancer should use, indicate it here.
    ## Default: Automatically assign a random, ephemeral IP
    # publicIp:
    ## If there should be firewall rules restricting the load balancer to a limited set of IPs, specify those IPs below
    ## in CIDR format. If all IPs shoud be allowed access, set the CIDR as "0.0.0.0/0"
    allowedIps:
      - "0.0.0.0/0"
    ## If there is a Hostname associated with this site, add it here and it will be rendered in the documentation.
    # hostName:

## How many versions of the deployment to run on kubernetes
## Default: 2
deployment:
  replicas: 1

## More generally, a "request" can be thought of as "how much is this container expected to need usually". it should be
## possible to burst outside these constraints (during a high load operation). However, Kubernetes may kill the pod
## if the node is under too higher load and the burst is outside its request
##
## Limits are hard limits. Violating them is either impossible, or results in container death. I'm not sure whether
## making these optional is a good idea or not; at the moment, I think I'm happy to defer QOS to the cluster and try
## and keep requests close to usage.
##
## Requests are what are used to determine whether more software "fits" onto the cluster.

## Monitoring adds the prometheus.io annotations to pods and services, so that the Prometheus Kubernetes SD mechanism
## as configured in the examples will automatically discover both the pods and the services to query.
##
## This defaults on, as the annotations should do no harm where Prometheus is not available but will automatically
## expose the application where Prometheus is.
