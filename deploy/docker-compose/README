# Docker Compose

This environment is designed for spinning up Magento 2 locally and during the build, such that either

- The developer can work on it
- The build process can compile

It will bring up an environment quite similar to the production environment (there are some deviations in the networking).

The Makefile at the repository root is the only way I puppet this. If you are curious, raise an issue and I will improve
the docs.
